# build-your-own-notepad

An educational project that demonstrates how to build a simple yet functional Notepad-like text editor using Python and Tkinter.

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install tk
```

> On some platforms Tkinter is bundled with Python and you may not need to install `tk` separately.

## Usage

Run the application from the project root:

```bash
python main.py
```

This launches a window with a basic text editor, file menu, and scrollable text area. Use **File → Open...** to load files, **File → Save** or **Save As...** to persist changes, and close the window to trigger the unsaved changes prompt.

## Screenshot (optional)

If you capture a screenshot of the application in use, place it in the repository and reference it here.
